# ReactJS Typescript Airbnb configuration with Prettier and ESLint

## This project was created running the `npx create-react-app react-typescript-nextjs --template ts-prettier-eslint-airbnb` command

1. To use scss instead of regular css install sass package `npm install -S sass` and **NOT** the `node-sass` package as it is deprecated`
